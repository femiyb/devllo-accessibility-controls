- [ ] In `DA11Y\Accessibility_Controls`:
  - [ ] Only output UI if `enabled` is true
  - [ ] Apply position class based on `button_position`
- [ ] In `DA11Y\Assets`:
  - [ ] Optionally pass `button_position` and `enabled` to JS via localized config

7. Internationalization & Readme

7.1 i18n
- [ ] Wrap all PHP UI strings in `__()` / `_e()` with text domain `devllo-accessibility-controls`
- [ ] Ensure `load_plugin_textdomain()` points to `/languages`

8.1 Frontend behavior
- [ ] On default theme, confirm:
  - [ ] Trigger button appears on all frontend pages
  - [ ] Clicking trigger opens dialog
  - [ ] Escape closes dialog and focus returns to trigger
  - [ ] Tab/Shift+Tab stay within dialog while open
  - [ ] Text size controls visually change content scale
  - [ ] High contrast toggles correctly change background/text colors
  - [ ] Preferences persist after page reload

8.2 Admin behavior
- [ ] Settings page loads without errors
- [ ] Changing “Enable” option hides/shows frontend UI
- [ ] Changing “Button position” moves trigger as expected

Devllo Accessibility Controls – v0.3.0 Build Checklist

1. Scope for 0.3.0

1.1 Admin guidance focus
- [ ] Add an accessibility guidance/checklist experience for site owners
- [ ] Keep it explicitly non-audit, non-compliance, non-legal

1.2 What 0.3.0 should NOT do
- [ ] No automated “fix all issues” behavior
- [ ] No numeric compliance scores or badges
- [ ] No legal or WCAG compliance guarantees

2. Accessibility Guidance Admin Page

2.1 Page registration
- [ ] Add a new admin page under `Settings`:
  - [ ] Menu title: “Accessibility Guidance” (or reuse existing settings page with a second tab/section)
  - [ ] Capability: `manage_options`
  - [ ] Slug: e.g. `da11y_accessibility_guidance`

2.2 Page structure
- [ ] On the guidance page, include:
  - [ ] Intro paragraph clarifying purpose: guidance, not audit or legal advice
  - [ ] Short disclaimer message:
    - [ ] “These notes are informational only and do not constitute a compliance audit.”
  - [ ] Sections for:
    - [ ] Text & typography
    - [ ] Color & contrast
    - [ ] Keyboard & focus
    - [ ] Images & media
    - [ ] Motion & animation

2.3 Content for each section
- [ ] For each section, define 2–4 checklist items:
  - [ ] Each item has:
    - [ ] Title (e.g. “Maintain sufficient contrast”)
    - [ ] Short description explaining why it matters
    - [ ] Optional WCAG reference (e.g. “WCAG 2.1 – 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)”)
  - [ ] Clear, non-legal wording (no “guarantees”)

3. Checklist Data Model

3.1 Storage option
- [ ] Create a new option (e.g. `da11y_checklist`) or extend existing settings
- [ ] Structure:
  - [ ] Keys: stable identifiers for checklist items (e.g. `contrast`, `focus_visible`)
  - [ ] Values: status string, one of:
    - [ ] `reviewed`
    - [ ] `needs_attention`
    - [ ] `not_applicable`

3.2 Sanitization
- [ ] Implement sanitize callback to:
  - [ ] Ensure only known item keys are stored
  - [ ] Clamp values to allowed statuses

4. Checklist UI Behavior

4.1 Controls per item
- [ ] For each item in the admin UI:
  - [ ] Render title and description
  - [ ] Render status control:
    - [ ] A <select> or 3 radio buttons (Reviewed / Needs attention / Not applicable)

4.2 Saving behavior
- [ ] Integrate with WordPress Settings API:
  - [ ] `settings_fields()` + `do_settings_sections()` in the guidance page form
  - [ ] Save checklist statuses alongside other plugin settings

4.3 Visual cues
- [ ] Optionally add minimal visual cues:
  - [ ] Different text or subtle color for each status (e.g. neutral vs needs-attention)
  - [ ] Keep contrast and readability high

5. Optional “Basic Checks” (Informational Only)

5.1 Basic checks section
- [ ] Add an “Informational checks” area on the guidance page with clear disclaimer:
  - [ ] “These checks are partial and informational. They are not a full audit.”

5.2 Safe checks to implement
- [ ] Consider adding 1–3 very limited checks, such as:
  - [ ] Detect if a skip link is present in the theme output
  - [ ] Detect CSS rules that remove focus outlines (e.g. `outline: none` without replacement)
  - [ ] Approximate base font size check (warn if very small)

5.3 Output format
- [ ] For each check, display:
  - [ ] Simple message (e.g. “A skip link was not detected on the homepage.”)
  - [ ] Clear note that this is a heuristic, not a definitive assessment

6. Documentation & Positioning

6.1 Readme updates
- [ ] Update `readme.txt`:
  - [ ] Add a short section describing the admin accessibility guidance/checklist
  - [ ] Emphasize that it is an awareness tool, not a scanner or report

6.2 In-plugin messaging
- [ ] At the top of the guidance page, clearly state:
  - [ ] “This page provides guidance and a checklist to help you think about accessibility.”
  - [ ] “It is not a compliance audit or legal advice.”

7. Tests for v0.3.0

7.1 Admin behavior
- [ ] Guidance page appears under Settings for users with `manage_options`
- [ ] Checklist statuses can be changed and persist correctly
- [ ] Optional basic checks display messages without causing errors

- [ ] All controls on the guidance page are keyboard accessible
- [ ] Headings and structure are logical for screen readers


Devllo Accessibility Controls – v0.4.0 Build Checklist

1. Scope for 0.4.0

1.1 Basic automated checks (admin-only)
- [ ] Add a “Run basic checks” action on the Accessibility Guidance page
- [ ] Implement a few small, safe, clearly messaged checks
- [ ] Store and display results for admins only

1.2 Guardrails
- [ ] No compliance scores or “pass/fail” ratings
- [ ] No legal or WCAG compliance guarantees
- [ ] Clear messaging that checks are partial and informational

2. “Run Basic Checks” UI

2.1 Button and layout
- [ ] On `Settings → Accessibility Guidance`, add:
  - [ ] A “Run basic checks” button
  - [ ] A results area (e.g. a list under “Basic automated checks”)
- [ ] Ensure the button is:
  - [ ] Keyboard accessible
  - [ ] Clearly labeled (e.g. “Run basic accessibility checks”)

2.2 Request handling
- [ ] Implement a secure way to trigger checks:
  - [ ] Either via a form submit with nonce
  - [ ] Or via AJAX (`wp_ajax_...`) with capability checks and nonce
- [ ] Ensure only users with `manage_options` can run checks

3. Check #1 – Skip Link Presence (Homepage)

3.1 Implementation
- [ ] Retrieve the homepage HTML (e.g. `get_home_url()` + `wp_remote_get()` or output buffering)
- [ ] Search for a skip link near the top of the document:
  - [ ] Look for `<a>` with `href` pointing to an in-page anchor (`#content`, `#main`, etc.)
- [ ] Be tolerant of variations and avoid strict assumptions

3.2 Output
- [ ] If a likely skip link is detected:
  - [ ] Show a message like: “A skip link appears to be present on the homepage.”
- [ ] If no skip link is detected:
  - [ ] Show a message like: “We did not detect a skip link on the homepage; consider adding one to improve keyboard navigation.”
- [ ] Add a note that this is a heuristic, not a definitive assessment

4. Check #2 – Focus Outline Removal in CSS

4.1 Implementation
- [ ] Inspect enqueued styles for rules that remove focus outlines:
  - [ ] Search for `outline: none` or `outline: 0`
  - [ ] Optionally, limit search to theme stylesheets
- [ ] Avoid over-parsing; a simple text search is acceptable

4.2 Output
- [ ] If no outline removal is detected:
  - [ ] Show a message like: “We did not find CSS that removes focus outlines.”
- [ ] If outline removal is detected:
  - [ ] Show a message like: “We found CSS rules that remove focus outlines; ensure a visible focus style is still provided.”
- [ ] Remind admins this is a partial check and not exhaustive

5. Check #3 – Base Font Size Heuristic

5.1 Implementation approach
- [ ] Use a small frontend JS snippet (enqueued only when checks are requested or for admins) to:
  - [ ] Read computed font size on `html` or `body` (e.g. `getComputedStyle`)
  - [ ] Send that value back to the server or store it in an option/transient
- [ ] Alternatively, display the computed size in a notice on the guidance page sourced from JS

5.2 Output
- [ ] Show a message like:
  - [ ] “Base font size appears to be approximately 16px.” (or whatever is detected)
- [ ] If detected size is small (e.g. < 16px):
  - [ ] Add: “This may be small for some users; verify that text is comfortably readable.”

6. Results Storage and Display

6.1 Storage
- [ ] Create an option or transient (e.g. `da11y_check_results`) to store:
  - [ ] Timestamp of last run
  - [ ] Per-check outcomes and messages

6.2 Display
- [ ] On the guidance page, show:
  - [ ] When checks were last run (human-readable timestamp)
  - [ ] A list of messages per check
- [ ] Ensure messages are:
  - [ ] Clear
  - [ ] Non-technical where possible
  - [ ] Framed as “possible issues” or “observations”

7. Documentation & Messaging

7.1 Readme updates
- [ ] Update `readme.txt` to mention:
  - [ ] “Basic automated checks” available for admins
  - [ ] They are partial and informational only

7.2 In-plugin messaging
- [ ] On or above the “Run basic checks” button, add:
  - [ ] Text like: “These checks are limited and do not replace a full accessibility audit.”
- [ ] Ensure wording does not over-claim or imply compliance

8. Tests for v0.4.0

8.1 Admin behavior
- [ ] “Run basic checks” button works for admins with `manage_options`
- [ ] Results persist across page reloads
- [ ] Running checks again updates the timestamp and results

8.2 Safety and robustness
- [ ] Network failures (for homepage fetch) show a friendly message, not a fatal error
- [ ] CSS scanning handles missing or unreadable styles gracefully
- [ ] JS for font-size detection does not break the frontend for regular visitors


Devllo Accessibility Controls – v0.5.0 Build Checklist

1. Scope for 0.5.0

1.1 Frontend UX & accessibility polish
- [ ] Refine the accessibility widget UI for clarity and responsiveness
- [ ] Add explicit close controls and state indicators

  - [ ] Accessible label (e.g. “Close accessibility settings”)
  - [ ] Keyboard focusable and operable via Enter/Space
- [ ] Ensure Escape key and close button both call the same close logic

2.2 Trigger state indicators
- [ ] Add `aria-expanded` or similar attribute on the trigger button
- [ ] Keep it in sync with dialog open/close state in JS

2.3 ARIA & semantics review
- [ ] Review `role="dialog"` usage and consider `role="alertdialog"` only where appropriate
- [ ] Confirm `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` reference visible elements
- [ ] Ensure no redundant or misleading ARIA attributes

2.4 Responsive layout
- [ ] Test the dialog and controls on small screens
- [ ] Adjust spacing/stacking so controls remain usable on mobile

3. Keyboard & Screen Reader Flow

3.1 Focus order and loops
- [ ] Verify focus order inside the dialog is logical
- [ ] Ensure focus trap logic is robust with additional controls (close button, new toggles)

3.2 Screen reader announcements
- [ ] Confirm dialog opening is announced clearly by at least one screen reader
- [ ] Ensure new controls (close button, any additional toggles) have clear labels and state feedback

4. Developer Extensibility

4.1 Filters for defaults
- [ ] Add filters to allow developers to override:
  - [ ] Default enabled features (text size, contrast, dyslexia, reduced motion)
  - [ ] Default button position

4.2 Markup customization hooks
- [ ] Add actions (do_action) around:
  - [ ] Before/after trigger button
  - [ ] Before/after dialog sections
- [ ] Keep defaults intact so hooks are optional

4.3 Config object extensibility
- [ ] Allow additional data to be injected into the localized JS config via a filter

5. Documentation & Examples

5.1 Developer docs
- [ ] Document new filters/actions in a simple “Developer Notes” section (e.g. in readme or a separate doc)
- [ ] Provide minimal code examples for:
  - [ ] Changing default button position via a filter
  - [ ] Disabling a feature globally via a filter

5.2 Readme updates
- [ ] Update `readme.txt` to mention:
  - [ ] Improved UI/UX for the widget and dialog
  - [ ] New hooks available for developers

6. Tests for v0.5.0

6.1 Frontend behavior
- [ ] Close button and Escape both close the dialog and restore focus correctly
- [ ] `aria-expanded` on trigger reflects open/closed state
- [ ] Dialog remains usable and readable on mobile devices

6.2 Accessibility & extensibility
- [ ] New hooks do not break existing behavior when unused
- [ ] Screen reader and keyboard tests still pass after UI changes
